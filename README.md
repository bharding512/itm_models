# itm_models

Simple wrapper for other Python wrappers of ITM models like MSIS, IRI, and IGRF.

At least for now, this is intended as a simple personal codebase to replace the functionality of pyglow, and provide a uniform xarray-based interface.

If used in a publication, please credit the underlying wrappers appropriately:

- pymsis (https://github.com/SWxTREC/pymsis)
- PyIRI (https://github.com/victoriyaforsythe/PyIRI)
- pyigrf ()


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bharding512/itm_models.git

```
